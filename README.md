# Bookmarker++

## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Consider "Dave's Pancakes", Dave's budding business. In the infancy of his business, he is still learning what websites he needs to use to purchase ingredients, to research his competition, and to attain the newest technologies in the booming pancake industry. However, as time goes on, he realizes that he now uses the same websites to complete each of these tasks, and he loses valuable time needing to reopen each of these websites. Even more difficult, sometimes these websites are down and he only finds out once he attempts to access them! What is Dave to do?

Fortunately for Dave, the gracious, glorious, and incredibly humble inventor of this project released Bookmarker++. Now, Dave can record all of his necessary websites in handy directories for each topic! Additionally, Bookmarker++ informs him whenever any of these servers are down, so he does not need to wonder if his own connection has failed or not. 

Once Dave implements Bookmarker++ into his business, "Dave's Pancakes" will be featured in every corner of the world. Because his managing time has been cut in half, all other breakfast commodities will become more irrelevant than the 2015 Fantastic Four movie. Truly, Bookmarker++ is the key for economic triumph and lasting joy.
